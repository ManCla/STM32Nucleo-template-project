# Project Template

This repo contains a template for projects on the _STM32F446 Nucleo-64_ board.

The idea is that the project contains minimal working code but at the moment it is far from it.
It was initialized using the STMCube development software as a starting point.

## Make targets
 * all
 * flash
 * clean
 * connect
 * openocd
 * gdb
