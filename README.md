# Project Template

This repo contains a template for projects on the [STM32F446 Nucleo-64](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) board based on the [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org/) operative system..

The idea is that the project contains a basic working example.
It was initialized using the STMCube development software as a starting point.
